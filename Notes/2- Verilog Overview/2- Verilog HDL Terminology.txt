1. Verilog HDL Terminology:
    -> HDL: stands for Hardware Description Language, is a software programming language that is used to model a piece of hardware.
    -> HDLs have two ways to model a circuit:
        > Behavior Modeling:
            - A component is described by its input/output response.
            - We are describing the functionality of the circuit, and not its structure.
            - Synthesis tools create the correct circuits that match the behavior described.

        > Structural Modeling:
            - A component is described by its interconnecting lower-level components/primitives.
            - Both functionality and structure are described.
            - HDL engineers call out particular hardware elements (lower-level components) and wire them together.
            - A higher-level component consists of multiple lower-level components.
            - Hardware elements can be as simple as an OR/AND gate or a model that represents another layer of abstraction.
