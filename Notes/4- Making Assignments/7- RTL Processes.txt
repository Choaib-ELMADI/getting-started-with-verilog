1. RTL Processes:
    -> There are two types of RTL processes:
        > Combinatorial processes:
            - These processes are sensitive to all inputs used in the combinatorial logic.
            - The always block includes all these input signals in the sensitivity list.
            - always @ (a, b, sel) ...
            - always @ * ...
        > Clocked processes:
            - These processes are sensitive to a clock or/and control signals.
            - Sensitivity list can be further controlled by adding keywords:
                + posedge: positive edge, to trigger the block at positive edge transitions only.
                + negedge: negative edge, to trigger the block at negative edge transitions only.
