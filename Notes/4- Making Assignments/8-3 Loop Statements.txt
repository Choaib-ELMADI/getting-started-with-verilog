1. Forever Loop:
    -> It executes continually, but it's not synthesizable.
    -> It's important to make sure that time advances between loop iterations.
    -> Example:
        initial begin
            clk = 0;
            forever #25 clk = ~clk; // A period of 50 time units === 50psec
        end

2. Repeat Loop:
    -> It executes a fixed number of times.
    -> Example:
        if (rotate == 1)
            repeat (8) begin
                temp = data[15];
                data = { data << 1, temp };
            end

3. While Loop:
    -> It executes if the associated expression is true.
    -> Example:
        initial begin
            count = 0;
            while (count < 101) begin
                $display ("Count = %d", count);
                count = count + 1;
            end
        end

4. For Loop:
    -> It executes the initial assignment at the start of the loop and then executes the loop body if the associated expression is true.
    -> Example:
        for (i=4; i<=7; i=i+1) begin
            result[i] = result[i-4];
        end
