1. Format:
    case { expression }
        <condition_1>:
            { sequence of statement(s) }
        <condition_2>:
            { sequence of statement(s) }
        ...
        default: // (Optional)
            { sequence of statement(s) }
    endcase

2. Example:
    always @ * begin
        case (sel)
            2'b00  : q = a;
            2'b01  : q = b;
            2'b10  : q = c;
            default: q = d;
        endcase
    end

3. Other Fomrs of Case Statements:
    -> "case" treats 'X' and 'Z' as logic values. Don't care characters are denoted by '?'.
    -> "casez" treats both 'Z' and '?' in the case conditions as don't cares.
    -> "casex" treats 'X', 'Z' and '?' in the case conditions as don't cares.
