1. Procedural Assignments:
    -> Procedural assignments reside inside of procedural blocks.
    -> There are two types of procedural assignments:
        - Blocking assignments (=)
        - Non-blocking assignments (<=)
    -> Blocking assignments (=) are executed in the order they are specified in a sequential block.
    -> Non-blocking assignments (<=) allow scheduling of assignments without blocking execution of the following statements in a sequential block.
    -> The left-hand side operand must be a variable data type.
