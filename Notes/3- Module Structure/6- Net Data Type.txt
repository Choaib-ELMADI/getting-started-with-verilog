1. Net Data Types:
    -> Here are four most commonly used net data types, supported by synthesis:
        > wire    : represents a node or connection.
        > tri     : represents a tri-state node.
        > supply0 : logic '0'
        > supply1 : logic '1'

2. Bus Declarations:
    -> <data_type> [MSB:LSB] <signal_name>;
    -> <data_type> [LSB:MSB] <signal_name>;
