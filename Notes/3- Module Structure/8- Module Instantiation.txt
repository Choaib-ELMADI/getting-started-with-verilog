1. Instantiation Format:
    -> Once a model is declared, it may be instantiated at a higher-level component.

    -> <component_name> #<delay> <instance_name> (port_list);
        > <component_name>:
            - The module name of your lower-level component.
        > #<delay>:
            - Delay through component, during simulation only.
            - This one is optional.
        > <instance_name>:
            - Unique name applied to individual component instance.
        > <port_list>:
            - List of signals to connect to the component.

    -> By instantiating models, you can create designs with multiple levels hierarchy, to achieve easier maintainability.

2. Connecting Module Instantiation Ports:
    -> When connecting signals to lower-level module ports, there are two methods to define the connections:
        - By ordered list
        - By name

    -> By ordered list:
        - Port connections are defined by the order of the port list in the lower-level module declaration.
        - Order of the port connections DOES matter.
        > half_adder u1 (c1, s1, a, b);
        ->> c1, s1, a and b are signals within the higher-level module.

    -> By name:
        - Port connections are defined by names.
        - Order of the port connections DOES NOT matter.
        > half_adder u2 (.co(c1), .sum(s1), .a(a), .b(b));
        ->> c1, s1, a and b are signals within the higher-level module.
        ->> co, sum, a and b are the ports of the lower-level module.
