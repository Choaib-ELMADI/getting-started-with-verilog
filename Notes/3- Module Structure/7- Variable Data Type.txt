1. Variable Data Types:
    -> Variables can be any one of the following:
        > reg : unsigned variable of any bit size.
        > reg signed is used for signed implementation.
        > integer : signed 32-bit variable.
        > real, time, realtime : for simulation purposes only, no sunthesis support.

    -> Variables can be assigned only within a procedure, a task or a function.

    -> Variables can't be continuously driven using the "assign" keyword.

2. Bus Declarations:
    -> reg [MSB:LSB] <signal_name>;
    -> reg [LSB:MSB] <signal_name>;
