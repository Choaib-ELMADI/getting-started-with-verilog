1. Net Data Types:
    -> Nets represent physical interconnects between processes or functional blocks (Mux, Adder, ...).
    -> Nets need to be driven continuously, and they don't store values.
    -> The "assign" operator continuously drive a net. Delays can be added to continuous assign statements.

2. Variable Data Types:
    -> Variables represent elements that store data temporarily.
    -> Variable data types may be synthesized into hardware flip-flops, registers or combinatorial nodes.
